This project uses docker-compose up to create a container, presenting Django's web scraping and data analysis programs with Docker.

After starting the server, the IP address of the Django website is localhost:18888.

If you want to create a container, use the following command in the same folder as the docker-compose.yaml file.

```
docker-compose up
```
